# brew-mac-setup
Setup config to take an empty mac and build out a decent programming environment with iterm and zsh and a host of other useful tools.

Uses mostly brew. You should be able to run this straight from a brand new mac with a standard shell.

## Usage
```bash
# Download the setup.sh script
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wafer-bw/brew-mac-setup/master/setup.sh -O
# Allow script to be executed
chmod +x setup.sh
# Run it
./setup.sh
```
